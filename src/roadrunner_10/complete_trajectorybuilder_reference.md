# Complete TrajectoryBuilder Reference

### Ingredients

1. A fully tuned Road Runner 1.0 setup _**or**_ [MeepMeep for Road Runner 1.0](https://github.com/acmerobotics/MeepMeep)


### The Problem

The current [TrajectoryBuilder Reference](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/builder-ref/) in 
the official Road Runner 1.0 docs only has a few TrajectoryBuilder methods, and does
not explain them very well in depth. This is a complete reference for more methods in 
the TrajectoryBuilder class for Road Runner 1.0.
