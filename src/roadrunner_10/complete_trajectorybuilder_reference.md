# Complete TrajectoryBuilder Reference

### Ingredients

1. A fully tuned Road Runner 1.0 setup _**or**_ [MeepMeep for Road Runner 1.0](https://github.com/acmerobotics/MeepMeep)


## The Recipe

### The Problem

The current [TrajectoryBuilder Reference](https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/builder-ref/) in 
the official Road Runner 1.0 docs only has a few TrajectoryBuilder methods, and does
not explain them very well in depth. This is a complete reference for more methods in 
the TrajectoryBuilder class for Road Runner 1.0.

### The Solution: TrajectoryBuilder Reference
You must first run the OpMode from the Driver Station and then stop it once the robot's speed stops increasing.
Finally, you can open the tuning page on your robot's Wi-Fi network, as the Road Runner docs say.
