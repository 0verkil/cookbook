# introduction

Welcome to the Cookbook. Enjoy your stay :)

The Cookbook is essentially a "handbook" maintained by the community for common (or not) issues that people have faced. The original motivation for this was to better prepare my team (4017) for when I left, since we've gained so much knowledge over just a single year that may eventually be lost. Throughout our region, I have seen many teams be completely lost after a great programmer or designer leaves, because they were simply not taught. 

While a list of problems and solutions is not "teaching one how to fish", it serves as an incredibly helpful guide to just get things working. I hope by making my lil' cookbook open source, **everyone** can both use and build on my limited knowledge base.

If you (or anyone) has a problem, I'd love if you could make a lil' "recipe" and help anyone else in the future :)
